# Gittip Development Environment

Gittip aims to provide multiplatform support for development via
Vagrant.

## Requirements

While not specifically required, the indicated versions have been vetted
as working.

  * [Virtualbox 4.3.8](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * [Vagrant 1.4.3](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## First-time setup

You should only need to run these commands once, when you first start
using this Vagrant environment.

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef
```

## Recommended plugins

While not strictly necessary, they will make working with Vagrant a bit
simpler and/or standardized.
